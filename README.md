# C++ methodology
This methodology is used for practical study of C++. Project contains code examples of language elements, paradigms, design patterns. Additionaly there could be found usage of boost library, implementation of sorting and searching algorithms, exercises and applications. Implementation usage is demonstrated with unit tests. Project could be usefull for study of language or for training.
